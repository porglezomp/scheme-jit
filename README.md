# Scheme JIT

Our goal is to demonstrate measurable benefits from some JIT optimizations.
We want tail call optimization so that weâ€™ve got places to do loop optimization, so we'll have more visible improvements.
We want some monomorphization or something to get into an interesting JIT optimization.

## Values
- Numbers
- Symbols
- N-tuples (is `nil = []`?)
  Lists are nested pairs, so `'(1 2 3)` is `[1 [2 [3 []]]]`
- Closures

## Monomorphization opportunities
- Specializing higher-order functions for a given function
- Removing bounds checks on tuple indexing
- Removing arity checks when calling functions
- Removing type checks before arithmetic / polymorphic comparison / etc.
