# Scheme JIT

Our goal is to demonstrate measurable benefits from some JIT optimizations.
We want tail call optimization so that weâ€™ve got places to do loop optimization, so we'll have more visible improvements.
We want some monomorphization or something to get into an interesting JIT optimization.

## Values
- Numbers
- Symbols
- N-tuples (is `nil = []`?)
  Lists are nested pairs, so `'(1 2 3)` is `[1 [2 [3 []]]]`
  Immutable data
- Closures

## Monomorphization opportunities
- Specializing higher-order functions for a given function
- Removing bounds checks on tuple indexing
- Removing arity checks when calling functions
- Removing type checks before arithmetic / polymorphic comparison / etc.

## Special Forms

- `(define (f x ...) body ...)`
- `(if p t f)`
- `(quote x)`

## Builtin functions

- `(typeof x)`
- `(vector-make n x)`
- `(vector-index v n)`
- `(vector-set! v n x)`
- `(vector-length v)`
- `(pointer= a b)`
- `(number= a b)`
- `(symbol= a b)`
- `(symbol< a b)`

And arithmetic operators

## Prelude

- `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `not`
- `number?`, `symbol?`, `vector?`, `function?`, `pair?`, `nil?`
- `cons`, `car`, `cdr`

## Bytecode design

Split operations into many instructions.
For example, an `add_num` instruction wouldn't check the types of its arguments, typechecking would be separate.
Bad for efficiency, good for evaluating the effectiveness of JIT optimizations at removing bounds checks / type checks / etc.

We pick a register machine, in the hopes that it'll be easier to translate for optimizations.

## Sample code

```scheme
(define (nil? xs) (= xs []))
(define (car xs) (nth xs 0))
(define (cdr xs) (nth xs 1))
(define (cons x xs) [x xs])
(define (pair? x) (= (vlen x) 2))

(define (list? xs)
  (if (nil? xs)
    true
    (if (pair? xs)
      (list? (cdr xs))
      false)))

(define (map0 f xs)
  (if (nil? xs)
    []
    (cons
      (f (car xs))
      (map0 f (cdr xs)))))

(define (reverse-onto xs acc)
  (if (nil? xs)
    acc
    (reverse-onto
      (cdr xs)
      (cons (car xs) acc))))
      
(define (map-onto f xs acc)
  (if (nil? xs)
    acc
    (map-onto
      f (cdr xs)
      (cons (f (car xs) acc)))))
      
(define (map f xs)
  (reverse-onto
    (map-onto f xs [])
    []))
```
